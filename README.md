<h1>Project 1: React.js Integration for a Basic Homepage</h1>h1>
This project showcases the integration of React.js to develop a dynamic homepage. The core structure of the homepage is built using two primary components: Navbar and Hero.
Through this project, we demonstrate how React's component-based architecture can be effectively used to create a clean, maintainable, and user-friendly homepage layout.
